# ENGS 31 Final Project
Andy and I teamed up for the ENGS 31: Digital Electronics final project in August 2025. We chose a project that we thought would teach us as much as possible. The final result is an FPGA-based graphics engine that renders a 3D tetrahedron which can be rotated via the keyboard in real time. We learned a ton on this project, both about graphcis and linear algebra on the FPGA.
